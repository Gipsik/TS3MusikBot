# TS3MusikBot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JackRyder/TS3MusikBot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JackRyder/TS3MusikBot)

## Teamspeak3 Music Bot capable of getting requested songs and playing them through a teamspeak music user.

## As of last update this project is deprecated from this repo. Feel free to fork and do whatever, but I don't plan on maintaining this anymore. I do have a discord bot built, so if you want to help or use that, [click here](https://github.com/JackRyder/SpagBot/)

###Documentation / Setup instructions

Here's a simple way of getting the bot setup. To make it work you want to have a server, or just another machine that you can work with.

#### Dependencies:

* .NET Framework 4.6.1 or above (This requires Windows 7 SP1 or above)
* A virtual audio device, (I recommend CABLE Virtual Audio).
* VLC Media Player
* Teamspeak3, and access to a mod/admin serverquery account
* DirectX, may be required also.

Setup instructions:


* Install all dependancies shown above.
* Setup the virtual audio to be main device for both playback and recording.
* Run program (with high privelledges for best performance) and fill in your credentials.
* If teamspeak is not running, the bot will detect this and will run it for you.

With any luck, the chat will tell you that the bot has successfully connected and is ready to take requests. Thanks for using my music bot!

#### Commands

> !play [song youtube url]' to request a song!

> !skip' to skip the current song!

> !song' to get the current song that's playing!

> !repeat' to toggle repeat for the current song that's playing!

> Do !help to the music bot and it will poke you with the commands too.
Thanks
